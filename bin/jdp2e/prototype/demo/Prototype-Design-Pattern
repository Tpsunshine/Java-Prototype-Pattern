==================

Prototype Pattern specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
and create new objects by copying the prototype.
Using the prototype pattern ,you can create new instances by copying or cloning an instance of an
existing one. This approach saves both time and money in creating a new instance from scratch.
